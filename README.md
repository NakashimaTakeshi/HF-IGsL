# HSR Software Development Environment (SDE)

The project aims to develop a common platform for research and development on the Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR) within the [Toyota HSR Community](https://hsr.io/). The effort is driven by the [HSR Software Development Environment Working Group (SDE-WG)](https://git.hsr.io/sdewg) and officially endorsed by [Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC)](https://global.toyota/en/). The ultimate goal is to provide a robust, scalable, virtualized, and documented environment to all internal and external contributors.
